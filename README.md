## Gekko (*this tool / bot*)

This tool is based on [REST APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), and is written the [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) dialect of javascript, which itself based on v8, Google's open source JavaScript engine.
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
**WARNING:** *Use Gekko at you own risk.*

### Automated reinvestment

Gekko comes with a few [technical analysis (TA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) methods which implement a single indicator (*DEMA, MACD, RSI, and PPO*). The parameters of these indicators are all configurable and changing them changes the outcome drastically. Gekko's interface allows you to add your own trading methods. Read more about that in the [documentation](https://github.com/kuzetsa/gekko/blob/master/docs/internals/trading_methods.md). 

**Note:** *much of this information is outdated, and/or not relevant to reinvestment-only mode.*

### Supported exchanges

Gekko reinvests cloud mining income on the following platforms:

- CEX.io (*Currently only BTC, planned support for NMC reinvestment.*)

### Plugin interface

Gekko also has a plugin system that can do certain things whenever something happens or let Gekko communicate through more platforms. Gekko implements the following example plugins:

- Campfire: Enables Gekko to talk on [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/) and report latest market data and advice.
- IRC bot: Enables Gekko to talk on IRC and report latest market data and advice.
- Mailer: Automatically sends email when your trading method has new advice.
- Profit Simulator (paper trader): Hold a fake portfolio and simulate trades based on advice.
- Redis Beacon: Broadcast events propagating through Gekko on [Redis pub/sub](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub).
